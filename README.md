# linkz
* Tired of bookmarking and never visiting that pages? 

* Tired of losting your bookmarked pages?

* Want to share that links with your buddies?  (Such a Persian styled ad. :)) )

**linkz** is a repo. for solving this problem. You know, first i think a create a Telegram channel or STH like that, but that's a pain in ass and the users of that is soooo limited. I created this to do that :))

it's Just a **markdown** document to share my useful links with my friends.

you can also create your own repo.
